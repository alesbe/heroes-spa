## 🌟 Features
- Search for heroes by name or filter by publisher
- Protected routes and user login with token (WIP)
- Local database
- CSS animations

## 🛠️ Tools
- Created with [React](https://es.reactjs.org/)
- Routes made with [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)
- Style and structure with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- Animations with [Animate.CSS](https://animate.style/)
- Built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

## 🐞 Known bugs
- Images don't show up in GH pages (The `HeroCard` component is getting the image from the wrong route)
- The index route don't show anything (Is not fixed until the protected routes are not finished!)

## ⚙️ Install
The idea is to add a Dockerfile, but I'm waiting to finish the project, or at least, a working version.

For now, you can use:
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
